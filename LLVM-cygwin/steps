I have started to experiment with LLVM recently. I do not have Visual Studio on my machine so I am experimenting with cygwin.

1. Download and read the "Getting Started guide" from llvm.org/docs
2. Download and install a subversion client. I used SlikSvn. I intend to build LLVM suite from source, and I think it is easier to check out the repository using a version control tool like subversion.
3. Download and install Git. There's a nice guide at <http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/>. This is not necessary but this allows me to store my scripts (such as this one) somewhere on github.
4. Download and install cygwin. It's sufficient to download the setup.exe and then install from the Internet. Check the "Requirement/software" section of the "Getting Started guide" as mentioned in step 1. In my experience, a lot of these tools are included by default when installing cygwin, but the following need to be explicitly specified when configuring the package list during the cygwin installation process:
dejagnu, expect, perl, GNU M4, autoconf, automake, libtool, make, unzip, zip
(For cygwin version 1.7.9)
5. Download and install GCC on Windows. I used bloodshed Dev-C++. Or maybe use mingw.
6. Download LLVM-GCC front end binary from: http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/llvm-gcc4.2-2.9-x86-mingw32.tar.bz2
7. run init_setup.sh to extract the sources and build LLVM;
8. run init_check.sh to compile a simple hello-world program;
